Here is the dataset for the article "Real time generative design of optimized structures with variable diversity and structural complexity"

There are two datasets in total, the cantilever beam dataset and the L-shaped beam dataset.

Due to file size limitations, the cantilever beam dataset is divided into two parts.

For data labels, complexity and loading information can be obtained from the naming of images.

For example, an image named "Fig_0_4_2_ori_hole_3. png" has a loading position of 0, a layout of 4 in the x direction, 2 in the y direction, and 3 holes.
